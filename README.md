#Manga Mood

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's the purpose of this app?

After burning through an epic manga series, the looming question for fans has always been: what’s next? The old-school method? Hitting up forums like MAL and scrolling through endless fan suggestions. But honestly, that's a shot in the dark.

Take "Berserk" as a case in point. Some dig it for its art, others for its admirable character development, and some just can't get enough of the hyper-violent action scenes. Now, imagine going to MAL and seeing "Claymore" recommended just because both have "action-packed sword fights." Feels off, right?

Enter Manga Mood. The big idea? If you're vibing with someone's manga choices, there's a solid chance you'll dig their other faves, no matter the genre.

Bottom line? Manga Mood isn't just another site—it's a smarter way to discover. Dive in and find what resonates with you.
