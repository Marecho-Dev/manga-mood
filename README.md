#Manga Mood

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's the purpose of this app?

After burning through an epic manga series, the looming question for fans has always been: what’s next? The old-school method? Hitting up forums like MAL and scrolling through endless fan suggestions. But honestly, that's a shot in the dark.

Take "Berserk" as a case in point. Some dig it for its art, others for its admirable character development, and some just can't get enough of the hyper-violent action scenes. Now, imagine going to MAL and seeing "Claymore" recommended just because both have "action-packed sword fights." Feels off, right?

Enter Manga Mood. The big idea? If you vibe with someone's manga picks, chances are you'll like their other favorites too, regardless of genre. Picture this: recommendations sourced from users who think and rate like you.

Bottom line? Manga Mood isn't just another site—it's a smarter way to discover. Instead of suggesting something just because it's another shonen, or it's another isekai, it matches vibes over surface-level themes. Manga Mood connects you with titles based on shared tastes with other readers. So, if you're vibing with someone's manga choices, there's a solid chance you'll dig their other faves, no matter the genre.
